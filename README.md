## Data Source

The data used in this project comes from ([http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)) 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The heart of this project lies in the exploratory data analysis phase. We will use Python, Pandas, and various visualization libraries to analyze the data, identify patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions.

## Data Cleaning

Before we can analyze the data, it's essential to clean and preprocess it. We will handle missing values, format data types, and ensure the data is ready for analysis.

## Visualization

Data visualization is a crucial aspect of this project. We will create informative graphs, plots, and charts to visually represent the insights we've discovered during the analysis.

## Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis will be performed to validate hypotheses and quantify relationships between variables. This will provide a more rigorous understanding of the data.

## Conclusion

In the conclusion section, we will provide a summary of the project's outcomes and discuss potential applications of the insights gained from the analysis.
